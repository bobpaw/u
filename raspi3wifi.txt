Steps for enabling "real" WiFi on Raspberry Pi 3
1.  Connect to the Internet with Ethernet or like. This is necessary because
    you have to install more packages.
2.  Launch a terminal or open a package manager of your choice.
3.  If you launched a terminal be sure to become super user (root). Password
    shouldn't be necessary; if it is, use 'sudo -s'.
4.  Install the package 'wpagui' (other names may include 'wpa_gui'). This
    is the GUI for wpa_supplicant (already installed) and makes
    configuration much easier. To install it, run:
    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y wpagui
    You can now safely close the terminal.
5.  Launch wpa_gui from the menu, or with 'Alt-F2'.
6.  Make sure to set the interface to wlan0 and NOT p2p-dev-wlan0. Once you
    have the WiFi working, you will need to repeat this step after every
    reboot.
7.  Scan for networks.
8.  Double click any of the 'education's.
9.  Set Authentication to WPA2-Enterprise (EAP)
10. Set EAP method to PEAP
11. Set Identity and Password to any AISD logon.
12. Set Inner auth to EAP-MSCHAPV2.
13. Click Add.
14. Click Connect.
15. Open a browser and open austinisd.org. (Most pages work)
16. It should open a page saying AISD BOYD; log in with the same credentials
    as before, remembering to check the Terms and Agreements box.
17. Once the wpa_gui screen shows an IP Address, you can click the X (it
    will continue running in the background).
